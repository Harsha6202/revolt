# **App Name**: Revolt Gemini Live Chat

## Core Features:

- Voice Interaction: Real-time conversational voice interface powered by Gemini Live API, focusing on Revolt Motors.
- Multi-lingual Support: Ability for the AI to speak in multiple languages, configured using the Gemini Live API, providing a global user experience.
- Interruption Handling: Handles user interruptions smoothly, allowing the user to interrupt the AI mid-response. Ensures that the AI stops, listens, and responds appropriately by correctly utilizing the Gemini API.
- Prompted Responses: The system instruction prompt tells the AI tool that it only provides information related to Revolt Motors products and services. Limit all its reponses and answers to Revolt Motors content.
- Simple UI: A clean, functional, and simple user interface for voice chat interactions. Clear visual cues for speech input and output.
- Low Latency: Low latency (1-2 seconds) between user input and AI response. Optimized server-to-server architecture for speed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#333333) to provide a sleek and modern feel, contrasting with the Revolt Motors brand identity, while maintaining readability.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222) for a modern, dark theme to reduce eye strain.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), an analogous hue, will highlight interactive elements and actions, making the user interface elements easily spottable and distinct against the dark backdrop.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and readable user interface. It is used for both headers and body text.
- Use simple, outlined icons to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic. Icons should represent common voice chat actions like muting, pausing, and sending messages.
- A straightforward layout with a prominent voice input area and a clear display of the AI's responses. Use whitespace to maintain readability.
- Subtle animations (e.g., pulsing microphone icon during voice input, fade-in effects for AI responses) to provide user feedback without being distracting.
